# Firebase Chat Exploration Lab

## Objectives

By the end of this, students should be able to:

- integrate Firebase into a small website
- build an instant messaging app
- deploy to github pages branch of your repo

## Instructions

Work in **pairs** to create a chat application using [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/). We haven't explored Firebase, but the documentation is excellent and creating a chat application is actually easier than it sounds.

Firebase provides a real-time database using server-sent events, which is an API for receiving push notifications from a server. Essentially, if you create objects and send them to Firebase, everything attached to your Firebase database will receive the updates as JavaScript objects!

Start with the [Firebase 5 minute tutorial](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#gettingstarted), and then onto the [Web Quickstart](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/quickstart.html); especially the parts about saving and retrieving data.

Firebase was just acquired by Google, so there's a strong chance you'll be seeing more technology based on this in the future.

**Make sure to fork/clone this lab**

After we've completed this, we will look at how to use Github Pages to deploy our working code to the web so that anyone can see our amazing application! No Heroku needed!
